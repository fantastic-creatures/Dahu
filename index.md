# In a Nutshell

Dahu provides an alternative to targeted advertising to companies that would like to participate in the online ads infrastructure without compromising the privacy of users.

# In Detail

## The Online Advertising Ecosystem

There are three actors involved in the online advertising ecosystem:
1. Advertisers who create ads and bid for space at the publishers' websites,
2. Publishers who provide a website to show these ads,
3. Users who look at these ads and potentially click on them.

The match between advertisers and publishers is usually done on platforms called ads exchanges. Publishers describe what kind of users and advertising space they have, while advertisers bid to place their ads on the websites. This programmatic way of targeting users for advertising purposes is known as targeted, behavioral, or surveillance advertising. Users are tracked across the board in order to match the preferences of the advertiser with the "right" publisher according to the audience that visits the websites. For example, reading an article on a local news website might involve this website tracking many user-specific behavioral markers while on the website such as types of articles the user opens, the amount of time spent reading and/or scrolling, number of articles read per session.

## The Problem
This type of tracking is at the heart of the problem of many privacy infringements as of today. There is a pushback to ban surveillance advertising initiatives (e.g., [1](https://www.bansurveillanceadvertising.com), [2](https://consumerfed.org/surveillance-advertising-factsheets/), [3](https://qz.com/1997873/apples-idfa-privacy-update-threatens-to-upend-the-ad-industry/)). The problem is that there is still no way to do online advertising without taking part of the surveillance infrastructure. There are only single efforts that are not available to the general public of marketers and advertisers.

## Our Solution

Dahu is exploring the painpoints and identifying opportunities to propose an alternative to targeted advertising. We want to provide means for each of these actors to respect and ensure privacy. Dahu provides an automated way for advertisers and publishers to advertise while removing behavioral information that could violate privacy regulations and compromise users.
